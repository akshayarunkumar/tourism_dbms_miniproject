Hello !

First install xampp and then start apache and mysql.

Then go to localhost/phpmyadmin and create a database name as tourism_db and then import the sql file

Note:- for database connection i have used port 3307 so make sure your xampp server is on the same port.

It is an web based bike rental system. It is based on PHP, HTML, CSS, JS and MySQL DB .
